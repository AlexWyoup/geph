## niaucchi: the traffic smuggler

niaucchi is a drop-in replacement for TCP that incorporates MiniSS/LLObfs obfuscation. It's specifically designed to *quickly* traverse the Great Firewall of China, so it also splits traffic over multiple TCP connections to get good throughput across the lossy, fat, and long links that typify international connections out of mainland China.
